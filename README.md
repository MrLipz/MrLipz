Jay Reed 🌟
Welcome to my GitHub profile!

Hi there! I’m Jay, a passionate maker, 3D printing enthusiast, and aspiring prop designer. My journey combines engineering, creativity, and hands-on craftsmanship to bring unique ideas to life.

🚀 What I Do
3D Printing: I specialize in modeling and printing miniatures, cosplay props, and functional designs for FDM printers like my Bambu Lab P1S with AMS.
3D Design: I work primarily in Blender and occasionally use Fusion 360 for mechanical and parametric designs.
Model Painting: Whether it’s miniatures or cosplay props, I hand-paint my creations, constantly learning new techniques.
Custom Projects: From a Ford Sierra Cosworth RS500 YB Engine model for my dad to a stitch counter for crafters, I love creating tailored solutions.
🎯 Goals
Build a brand around high-quality 3D printed models and props, offering raw, assembled, and fully painted pieces.
Develop functional and decorative items for makers, cosplayers, and hobbyists.
Explore new gear mechanisms and parametric designs to expand my engineering knowledge.
🛠️ Tech Stack
Modeling: Blender, Fusion 360
3D Printing: Bambu Studio, Orcaslicer, Superslicer
Languages: Python (basic scripting)
Electronics: Raspberry Pi for home automation and project controls
🌱 What I’m Learning
Advanced airbrushing and model painting techniques
Gear design and kinematics
Creating functional designs for cosplay props and mechanical projects
🌟 Fun Facts
I love experimenting with gears and mechanisms—from toys to tools.
I’m converting a section of my IKEA bookcase into a filament storage rack.
I’m working on an ambitious garden redesign project, featuring decking, slabs, and a custom-built garden room.
